Hello, and welcome to my first JavaFX program!

This is another program I completed in one of my Java courses.
It serves as a menu with a GUI programmed using the JavaFX library. The program is a simple student info storage app
that will allow the user to add and delete entries. When a user is added, a corresponding hash value will be entered into a 
hashmap file that will represent the stored new student info. Keep in mind that this save only exists as the program is running, so once
the program is terminated, the hashmap will revert back to the default that is programmed into the app. 

The purpose of this app was to text my abilities with using Java in conjunction with a  GUI library (JavaFX) so that I can learn
how to create Java programs with usable graphic interfaces as opposed to mere programs that run through the IDE console line. The JavaFX elements
are hand-typed in this program, though I definitely want to upload more programs using the SceneBuilder interface in the future!

I used the Netbeans IDE to facilitate running of this program. To run the program, make sure you have the JavaFX library installed in Netbeans, with the
version corresponding to the version of Java you have saved on your PC. 

Of course, feel free to change the absolute paths of the hashmap files 
(e.g. "C:\\Users\\Marco\\Documents\\MyJavaProjects\\summer2020\\Assignment5\\AssignmentHashmap.ser")
to suit your personal setup. You can find this in the code files; there are two of them located 
in the main package folder (marco.sheridancollege.lappytop.javafx). The Assignment.java file includes the JavaFX makeup
of the program's interface, and the AssignmentFXMLController.java file includes the executable commands that stem from
the interface presented in the Assignment.java file.

Thank you, and enjoy!
